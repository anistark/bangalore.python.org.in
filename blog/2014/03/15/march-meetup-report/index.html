            <p>&ldquo;Writing tests is an absolute waste of time&rdquo;, some of them say.</p>

<p>Well, we do not think so. The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/125797622/">March Bangpypers meetup</a> was a hands on workshop covering TDD with Django. Just like last time, an enthusiastic crowd of 42 attended the session. It was held at the Apigee office in Koramangala. Facilitated by <a href="https://twitter.com/sivaa_in">Siva</a>, the session started at around 10:30AM and went on till 3:30PM. Unlike the previous sessions, <a href="https://twitter.com/kracetheking">Kracekumar</a> was the only volunteer to help the participants.</p>

<p>The workshop started by telling everyone the importance of writing tests, the concept and theory of Test Driven Development and how it could help one tremendously while writing code. Although a bit hectic at first, it is a practice that would certainly pay off when it comes to catching the bugs in your code before it is deployed in production. <a href="https://github.com/sivaa/django-tdd">The Repo and the session notes can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>The session focussed on using <strong>selenium</strong> for writing functional tests and the Python <strong>unittest</strong> library for writing unit tests. As you can see from the notes, each step was implemented step by step, one at a time making sure that the crowd was following along. The functional tests were bundled in a standalone package whereas the unittests were written within the tests.py file of the newly created Django app.</p>

<p>The concept of writing tests for a piece of code that was not written, was quite alien to almost all the participants. &ldquo;TDD is like martial arts&rdquo;, stated Siva towards the end. &ldquo;You cannot learn it in one day. First you have to go through all the troublesome exercises before getting to the actual kicking and punching part&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Making voluntary, common mistakes in his code, the instructor made the participant experience newbie mistakes that anyone could make. Thereby making them think it through and finding a solution. The well laid out exercise along with the elegant presentation imparted a great deal of knowledge to the attendees.</p>

<p>The workshop was wrapped up by 3:30PM after which, all of us hungout a bit talking to each other about different technologies and how they compare with each other. Certain participants had a couple of doubts about the session to be clearted who stuck with Siva for a while to get everything cleared.</p>

<p>By 4:15, all of us were on our ways, waiting to come together once more for the next meetup!</p>
