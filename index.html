            <p>For September&#39;s session, we continued the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/242065713/">&ldquo;Machine Learning/ Deep Learning &rdquo;</a> theme. The venue was Synup in Koramangala, and we had 3 speakers. The first two talks were of 40-60 minutes and the last one was around 20 minutes. </p>

<p>The first talk was by Krishna Kant and his talk was titled <strong>&ldquo;Making Deep Learning Models Robust to Adversarial Attacks&rdquo;</strong>. He spoke about how any dataset can be attacked using whitebox and blackbox methods. Whitebox methods such as FGS, an implementation called DeepFool, BFGS and JSMA and Blackbox methods that would basically be using noisy images or adversarial examples generated using the aforementioned methods. He also spoke briefly about defending models against these attacks - using correct classification by training on adversarial examples and rejection of incorrect results.</p>

            <h1><a href=/blog/2017/07/15/jul-workshop/>Device Interfacing Workshop - July, 2017</a></h1>
            <div class="dateline">Saturday, July 15, 2017 <span>&raquo;</span> <a href="/archives/meetup/">meetup</a>, <a href="/archives/talks/">talks</a>, <a href="/archives/workshop/">workshop</a></div>

        <div class="item-body">
            <p>BangPypers organized a full-day workshop on 15/July/2017, titled, &#39;Device interfacing with Python&#39;. Workshop was conducted by folks from Zilogic Systems, Chennai &ndash; Vijay Kumar, Deepak, Babusubashchandar, and Rashid Muhammed &ndash; and the venue for the workshop was the corporate office of Treebo Hotels. Intent of the workshop was to initiate the participants on how to use Python programming language to interface with embedded hardware.</p>

<p>Workshop began with introduction to basics of embedded systems, understanding different types of operating systems, quick run through the GNU/Linux OS, then progressing towards hardware interfacing, device drivers, and serial communication, concluding with note on sysfs and how to use sysfs to control hardware. Workshop was a mix of theoritical concepts that preceded the hands-on sessions &ndash; Zilogic folks split the tasks of speaking as the slides rolled out for each session and helping the participants as part of the hands-on.</p>
<h2>Embedded Linux Introduction</h2>
<p>Deepak began this session where he explained the various embedded software models, and the technical differences between firmware, threaded OS, GPOS, and RTOS. Then he proceeded to explain GNU/Linux OS with emphasis on Linux Kernel, it&#39;s design model and the distinction between kernel and user space. This was followed by how files and file systems are managed in the kernel, the layout and the need for file systems. This concept was highlighted using an example of different file system formats including pseudo file systems like proc and sysfs. Linux&#39;s boot process and rootfs was quickly talked through.</p>

<p>After touching upon the idea of embedded Linux, it&#39;s pros and cons and the reasons why individuals are inclined to go for it, he explained the specifications and peripheral details of the Zilogic Zkit-ARM-VF51 and DietIO add-on board; this served as the target board for the workshop.</p>
<h2>Device Interfacing and Introduction to Device Drivers</h2>
<p>Focus of this session was device interfacing and Vijay discussed two concepts &ndash; memory interfacing and device interfacing. He explained how memory interfacing works under the hood i.e. how blocks are addressed in memory and how read and write transaction happens in memory and also, how the same transaction with multiple RAM chips (using decoding logic.)</p>

<p>He went on to explain how memory interfacing can be used to do device interfacing via the concept called, memory-mapped I/O. He gave an overview of what memory map is and how hardware devices are mapped as memory addresses and simplified this with examples of using display controller and serial controller. At this point, he mentioned that memory mapped I/O cannot be used for all devices and moved on to the concept called controller based IO where a controller interfaces between the CPU and the device, acting as a translator.</p>

<p>This was  illustrated with examples like serial controller, I2C controller, and USB controller. The slides and talk were interspersed with tinkering on the target HW by asking the participants to try out code snippets.</p>

<p>Next major topic began with brief tntroduction to device drivers wherein the speaker explained how the OS abstracts away the differences in the hardware from the applications, using device drivers. Device drivers provide a consistent interface for the applications which is made possible because Unix kernel considers everything as file including physical devices. This presents a similarity in accessing files and IO devices.</p>

<p>This session covered details of how device files work, major and minor mode, and how the kernel uses these modes to invoke the respective driver required by the device. This was emphasized with code examples to show how to read (and interpret) inputs of mouse events, audio playback, read hard-disk partition table &ndash; all of this aided by reading from or writing to only device files.  He highlighted the limitations with this approach &ndash; it&#39;s not possible to model all device operations, like control and configuration of the device, via reading and writing to files &ndash; and how it can be overcome with system call, <code>ioctl</code> with live example of ejecting the CD-ROM tray using ioctl.</p>
<h2>Serial Interface</h2>
<p>Babu handled this session in which the primary focus was about &#39;Serial Communication&#39;. With the short introduction on the internals of UART, it&#39;s cost effective in comparison to communication via Parallel Ports. He highlighted problems like, interference, attenuation caused due to out of board (or band ???) connections and solutions to overcome them. This was followed by a working exampple of a GSM modem listening to incoming text messages whose text was displayed on the LCD of the target HW using Python module, <code>PySerial.</code></p>

<p>&#39;I2C&#39;, an acronym for &#39;Inter-Integrated Circuit&#39;, a low speed serial bus developed by Philips, was taken up next. Outlining it&#39;s features, like, clock rates, master-slave architecture, he went on to describe the I2C controller and how it&#39;s used to connect I2C devices. Continuing with I2C protocol and how a transaction occurs, the participants, assisted by Babu and the rest of Zilogic folks, tried their hands on accessing accelerometer data and four way key using SMBus &ndash; this technology provides APIs for communicating with I2C slave.</p>
<h2>Sysfs</h2>
<p>Vijay started off this session by explaining about /proc  filesystem, how it was used to obtain system and active processes from the kernel. With the grwoth of complex hardware, it became a necessity to export hardware information to system programs and eventually &#39;/proc&#39; got cluttered with lots of non-process information. And also, the information in &#39;/proc&#39; was not programmatically parsable though it was human readable. And hence, sysfs was born, which is an in-memory file system that exports information from kernel space to user space.</p>

<p>With few slides to show the characteristics of sysfs and it&#39;s hierarchy, he explained as to how devices, using /sys/class, are grouped based on functionality and, /sys/bus, where devices are grouped based on their interface. The concepts of sysfs were demonstrated with a simple task involving how to read configuration information of network interfaces, device backlight, controlling radio switches (WiFi) using sysfs. The session ended with a comparison between ioctl and sysfs for controlling/configuring devices, and when to use what.</p>
<h2>GPIOs and PWM interface</h2>
<p>Deepak explained the concepts of binary state high or low with simple devices like LEDs and how GPIOs can be used to switch between either of the two states thus allowing to turn ON/OFF the LEDs. With brief description of how to set the direction of GPIO pins depending on whether they act as output or input, he showed how GPIO interfaces can be accessed from user space applications through sysfs. Participants tried controlling an RGB LED and reading input from key (with the help of sysfs) on the target HW via GPIO pins.</p>

<p>PWM, which stands for &#39;Pulse Width Modulation&#39;, was lined up next &ndash; Deepak explained what is PWM, duty cycle and how they can be used to control the power generated from the source. Session ended with the partcipants attempting to control the oscillations of the piezzon buzzer on the target HW and, the speed of a DC motor , both achieved through PWM using sysfs.</p>
<h2>ADC interface</h2>
<p>Babu took this final session which was about Analog-to-Digital Convertor(ADC) &ndash; need for ADC, which helps to convert analog values to digital and why there are hardware devices that generate analog values that cannot be directly consumed by microcontroller(s). He showcased how to read the voltage changes in the Light Dependent Resistor(LDR) on th target HW through ADC using sysfs.</p>

<p>BangPypers team is very thankful to the amazing folks from Zilogic for their time and effort in conducting this workshop on embedded systems. We also thank Treebo for hosting the workshop. Hope the workshop participants had great fun and learning!</p>

            <h3>What is BangPypers?</h3>
<p><br/></p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CSECd__UwAAlOl8.jpg" height="400" width="500"></p>

<p></br/></p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-decided-the-name-BangPypers-for-the-Bangalore-Python-User-Group">BangPypers</a> is a <a href="https://www.swaroopch.com/2005/01/22/first-bangalore-python-meetup/">twelve year</a> old group started by Anand B Pillai. For Half a decade <a href="https://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/">meetup group</a> is the anchor for organizing Python meetups in Bangalore. During the period, co-organizer has devised working for the team.</p>
<h3>Event Types?</h3>
<p>In last five years, the team organized Sixty-four meetups. Few early volunteers left the team. Moved to different city, nation, and continent. Kudos to everyone!</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C7MLfJ4VwAEMdNY.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>The events are half-day or whole day event. There are three main events; <a href="https://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/238929256/">Talks</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/238052401/">Workshops</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/225059174/">Dev Sprints</a>.</p>

<p>Talks are half a day event with minimum three speakers. Sometimes with six speakers. On an average, each session lasts for thirty to forty minutes. The team calls this as <code>full-length talks</code>. Another version of the talks is <code>short talks</code> or <code>Flash talks</code> of duration ten minutes.</p>

<p>Next format is the workshop. Workshops are a complete hands-on event for a half day or full day. The one or two speakers come together and handle a session.</p>

<p>The last format is Dev Sprint. Dev Sprint is a half a day or full day event. The developers visit the premise and work on the FOSS projects. Sometimes maintainers of the projects attend the event and help participants contribute.</p>

<p>All three event formats take different effort to organize. For example, talks and dev sprint require a higher degree of co-ordination to find speakers and mentors.</p>
<h3>What are the task involved?</h3><h4>Venue</h4>
<p>Finding the place for the meetup was hard in the beginning. Running a meetup in the same location, again and again, projects a company runs the meetup. Initial days were hard to find the venue. Friends and group members helped a lot. Later, attendees and business outreach team got in touch with us. Ninety participants attended the last meetup. Now the challenge is to find a bigger venue. When a company contacts us in meetup page or email to host us, we ask a handful of questions. Following are few</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the capacity of the venue?</li>
<li>Can you share photos of the place?</li>
<li>Do you provide Wi-Fi to guests?</li>
<li>Do you have proper table setup? The setup is mainly for workshops.</li>
<li>Can you offer us Snacks and Lunch (optional)?</li>
<li>Do you have two wheelers and four wheeler parking facility?</li>
</ul>

<p>In the past, we have forgotten to ask these questions and had issues. Some companies require participants to carry a Government issued Identification Card. Other companies ask for participants names in advance. We don’t share members contact information. One day before the event, the host coordinator receive the attendees name list. In one or two days, after the event, a volunteer sends out venue specific feedback to the hosts with a ‘Thank you’ note.</p>
<h4>Speakers</h4>
<p>The speakers and topic attract the audience for the meetup. The compelling content pulls the audience to step out of the house on the weekend. For a workshop, one speaker is sufficient and with few folks to help. Finding speakers for talks is the <em>real challenge</em>. Call for speakers happens three weeks before the event. A volunteer sends out an email to meetup group and <a href="https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/bangpypers">mailing list</a>. Then an announcement hits Twitter and FaceBook with Meetup link. The interested audience reply in email or comment on the meetup page. Sometimes talk slots are taken in a day, and sometimes there is one free slot. A follow-up is sent in next week when a talking slot is empty.</p>
<h4>RSVP</h4>
<p>The team&#39;s biggest challenge is knowing how many will attend the meetup. Till date, all the events were free of cost. So interested participants RSVP. Not everyone who showed interest show up for the event. During initial days, only 20% of participants who showed interest attended the meetup. Now the ratio is above 50%. RSVP opens six days before the event with 2X venue capacity with the open waitlist. Three days before a volunteer sends out an email to all participants who showed interest to un-RSVP in the case of any change in plans.</p>
<h4>Managing meetup page</h4>
<p>The meetup page contains details of every meetup. RSVP is accepted only on the meetup page. The members can message organizer for queries about participation, hiring, a chance for a speaking slot, hosting the meetup. The Volunteers answer the questions in the event comment section. The comment section is used differently before and after the meetup.</p>
<h4>On the day</h4>
<p>A volunteer reaches the venue half an hour before the start time and oversees the setup. During the meetup, volunteers introduce speakers, keep track of talk timings, share feedback link and answer individual queries. The volunteer also takes few pictures.</p>
<h4>Blog</h4>
<p>From the beginning, BangPypers event reports are available on the <a href="http://bangalore.python.org.in/">blog</a>. Every event has a separate blog post about attendees count, how was the event, photos, and other details. The blog post goes on to social networks, meetup group, and mailing list.</p>
<h4>Feedback form</h4>
<p>Feedback is the fruit of the event. Feedback gives us the sense of participants thoughts, a chance for speakers to improve, where did the organizing team slip and what do members expect from future meetups. Our feedback form is Google forms and shared at the end of the meetup. The feedback form has multiple choice questions and one optional text question.</p>
<h4>Planning</h4>
<p>The team uses Email and Whatsapp for internal communication to discuss labor sharing, whom to contact for the venue, what topics to discuss and who will be available during the meetup, how can we and post-mortem. During any month, the volunteers start planning for next two meetups. Whether the next meetups are workshop or talks, where to host etc. You can see the team members in the meetup group co-organization section.</p>
<h4>Video</h4>
<p>In last three meetups, a volunteer record talks using an iPhone and uploads to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIYL-l3N9VLFbqMum40D-1w">YouTube channel</a>. The video coverage is still at the experimental stage.</p>

<p>The organizing team spends a significant amount of time doing all the work. On an average, the team, not an individual spends somewhere between twelve to fifteen hours monthly to run the meetup.</p>

<p>It has taken years for us to reach this place. If you have read this far and manage a meetup group, take a couple of hours and write up how you organize the meetup. All of us can learn from each other.</p>

<p>Next blog post is about lessons from organizing the meetup. Stay tuned.</p>

        <div class="item-body">
            <p>For May&#39;s session, we continued with the &ldquo;Talks&rdquo; pattern, but we had a unique theme by name - <a href="https://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/238929256/">&ldquo;Journey to the Kernel&rdquo;</a>. The venue was VM Ware, and this time we had 5 speakers , all of them focusing in some way, on the internals of Python. The talks were each of 40-minutes. </p>

<p>The <em>first</em> talk was by Naveen Sivanandam Python of VM Ware on <strong>Containers - Deploying Web Services on Kubernetes</strong>. He spoke briefly about kubernetes and the typical infrastructure using a master,nodes, pods and services. He also demo-ed how to deploy 3 pods and run a flask app on them. The code for his talk along with the presentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/naveens/simple-flask-app">here</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>second</em> talk was by Dhilip Siva about <strong>Dictionaries in Python 2 and 3</strong>.<br>
This was quite a nice session with people learning about how a dictionary could possibly be implemented starting with falsehoods where an implementation of a dictionary was only seemingly one but violated the basic principles of it by indexing keys instead of hashing. Gradually this was built upon, to demonstrate collisions of keys and how to avoid them etc.</p>

<p>This was followed by a brief break where tea and biscuits were available at VM Ware. Naveen also spoke during this interval about how VM Ware was using Python. </p>

<p>The <em>third</em> talk was presented by Sasidhar and he spoke about <strong>How Import Works in Python</strong> i.e, what exactly happens when you say &ldquo;import math&rdquo; etc. in a Python program. He explained the different levels of searches that take place (first looking up in sys.module and then in the sys.meta_path and so on) finally resulting in the loading of the module. His code and slides can be obtained <a href="https://github.com/sdonapar/how_import_works">here</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>fifth</em> and final talk was by Piyus Gupta, speaking about the <strong>Concurrency and Parallelism</strong> in Python. He spoke about CPU scheduling , thread safety and demonstrated how different implementations with or without multiple CPUs/single or multi-threading/multiprocessing can positively or negatively influence the performance of programs.

            <p>For April&#39;s session, we went with the &ldquo;Talks&rdquo; theme again and this was hosted by Saloni of <a href="http://byteacademy.co/">Byte Academy</a> at <a href="https://www.cowrks.com/infinity-bangalore">CoWrks Infinity</a> and we had 4 speakers with diverse topics for talks, each with a 15 minute duration. </p>

<p>The first talk was by Arvind Padmanabhan. He spoke about <strong>Functional Programming</strong> and how it could be used in Python. In the process he illustrated the usage of libraries like functools, itertools, operator and also a third-party library called toolz which provides a lot of extensibility to the existing toolkit that Python offers off-the-shelf. His iPython notebook is available for download <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1q0Sut22G5RT24ycnN2RG0xM1E/view">here</a>.</p>

<p>The second talk was by Rivas Hameed about the <strong>Chain of Responsibility (CoR) Design Pattern</strong>.<br>
He spoke about how the pattern could be used in a real-world scenario, illustrating how an earlier system failed due to the lack of forethought and an efficient design pattern - this was mitigated by using the CoR pattern.</p>

<p>This was followed by a brief break where tea and biscuits were available at CoWrks to be partaken of. Byte Academy also briefly introduced themselves and mentioned the programs they were offering. </p>

<p>The third talk was presented by Vidya Sagar from VMWare and he spoke about <strong>Web Scraping using Python</strong> - specifically using Requests and Beautiful Soup. He also demonstrated the same with a demo of how he had performed the scraping of the website &ldquo;espncricinfo&rdquo;. His slides can be obtained <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/secret/t87SA6QAhR9bge">here</a> and the demo code for the same, <a href="https://github.com/vidhack/bangpypers_web_scraping">here</a></p>

        <div class="item-body">
            <p>For the second session in this month (March), we decided to conduct a beginners&#39; workshop on Algorithms implemented in Python and this was hosted by Karthika at <a href="https://www.axisbank.com/thoughtfactory/index.html">ThoughtFactory</a> and the speaker was Ankur (co-founder, <a href="http://numeratelabs.com/">Numerate Labs</a>). An afternoon session was conducted for this week as well and it started post-mic and projector logistics around 2.30 PM.</p>

<p>Ankur started with a description of time and space complexities, delving deeper into comparisons of different algorithms’ worst time complexities - taking sorting as his primary example. This was followed by allowing the attendees to implementing out the various sorting algorithms in Python on their own - bubble and selection for starters and then the slightly more complex - Merge Sort.</p>

<p>Then there was a 15 minute break with good snacks provided by ThoughtFactory.</p>

<p>The second half of the session focussed on searching and trees, specifically - Binary Search Trees. The scope of the overall session was decided to end here so as to allow for attendees to digest these preliminary topics, so that they would be able to appreciate the intermediate-level topics better in coming sessions.</p>

<p>Thanks to Ankur for conducting an informative workshop and to ThoughtFactory for hosting the event.</p>

<p>Hope you all had a good time learning. See you again next time! </p>

<p>Here are a few snapshots from the meetup - </p>

            <p>For this month (March), we conducted an IOT workshop hosted and presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/rawatsudhir">Sudhir Rawat</a> and Zeeshan at Microsoft.</p>

<p>The strength of attendance was around 75 people, more than 50% of those who had RSVP-ed which was a good indication of interest.</p>

<p>The first hour was spent in setting up the wifi connection for attendees and providing them with Azure credentials and distributing the Raspberry Pi kits (1 device per table was allotted - for 10 tables). Sudhir and Zeeshan had already arranged for these to be distributed efficiently, and that helped ease the whole process. Attendees also introduced themselves which allowed for a demographic expectation to be set  - most people wanted an introductory hands-on experience with IOT.</p>

<p>Once the logistics was out of the way, the IOT Hub setup, storage configuration etc on the Azure platform was taught. The Pi devices provided had been pre-loaded with Raspbian and Python programs to communicate with the device connected. The 3 main tasks that this workshop focused on was, observing how the fingerprint sensor connected to pin 3 (for our setup) of the device relayed an acknowledgement upon being touched, creating a new device on the IOTHub and sending messages using the device to the Azure Analytics module in the Hub using Python.</p>

<p>The talk was well recieved and the feedback was overall very positive, requesting that a second session be conducted to continue the pattern and material of this workshop.</p>

<p>See you all at the next meetup! :)</p>

<p>At 10AM, <a href="https://twitter.com/sivaa_in">Siva</a> started off the session (well actually, Haris was late by 10 minutes :P) by introducing REST and comparing it to other ways of API development.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/harisibrahimkv">Haris Ibrahim</a> rushed in at around 10.15 and quickly took over, starting with an apology.</p>

<p>Addressing the fact that REST has been around since 2000s, a quick explanation of what it all means was followed up with the hands-on workshop.</p>

<p>The session was structured as a top-down exercise, where the participants, along with the instructor, built a basic inventory system using all the magic (read abstraction) that DRF provides, and then breaking them up into pieces one by one.</p>

<p>It was quite interactive and at times the discussion went off on tangents addressing concerns that people had when building their products.</p>

<p>With a quick 10 minute break in between, we wrapped up the session at around 1.30PM. In case you missed attending the event and feel like going through the content, you can find it here:</p>

<p>In the previous meetup Abraham presented a talk on ansible. Many participants were interested in it and so we planned for workshop this time.</p>

<p>Abraham started workshop with brief explanation of virtualbox, vagrant and ansible. He helped participants to setup them.</p>

<p>After that he explained simple ansible modules like <code>ping</code>, <code>shell</code> e.t.c and how to run those on target machines.</p>

<p>Later he explained about ansible playbook and how to can configure them.</p>

<p>We had lunch break for about 30 minutes. After resuming from break, he showed a demo of deploying a django web app. Here he used 4 machines(1 load balancer and 3 web apps) and showed hot to automatically configure and orchestrate them.</p>

<p>Then he showed how to update all webservers with zero downtime.</p>

<p>Here are a few photos from workshop.</p>

<p>There were about 45 participants for the workshop, one of them personally thanking Krace for all the workshops that he had done previously. Apparently after attending them and learning Python, he recently got a Python gig.</p>

<p>Towards the end, a copy of Two Scoops of Django and Python 101 were circulated among the participants. Some of the participants and organizers hung around to discuss about the upcoming <a href="http://in.pycon.org">Python India Conference</a> and the <a href="http://pythonexpress.in">Python Express</a> initiative.</p>

<p>As was the case for the past couple of meetups, 50 people attended. The entire cafeteria got occupied and we had to pull in chairs around the area to accommodate those few who were late to join the party. Krace started off by doing a quick recap of what was covered during the last meetup. Making sure everyone was on the same page, he jumped into functions. Slowly building upon one function after the other, he hand held the crowd to be prepared for the scarier parts that were to follow.</p>

<p>By the time decorators came into the picture, everyone had their brains working high. After giving a quick peek, lunch was served around 1:00PM. In spite of the 1 hour lunch break, surprisingly, everyone finished off the Subway Burrito in a hurry, took a swing of the Mango Juice served along with it, and were ready by 1:30PM for the session to continue. Fed and their brain&#39;s chugging, we continued with decorators at 1:45PM.</p>

<p>Just before getting started, there was a special announcement. <a href="https://twitter.com/pydanny">Daniel Roy Greenfeld</a>, the co-author of Two Scoops of Django, had donated a copy of the new edition of his book to Bangpypers. We decided that the best way for the community to use the book would be to pass it on from person to person every month. Upon collectively agreeing to this norm, the book was awarded to its first keeper, <a href="https://twitter.com/sivaa_in">Siva</a>. Hopefully, the mantle will be passed on during each meetup from now on.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/pydanny">@pydanny</a> for giving two scoops to bangpypers.

<p>Finishing one part after the other, Krace made writing tests a parallel task from the beginning onwards. Giving a rock solid explanation on classes and its use, the workshop was concluded by 4:30PM. There were bonds strengthened, new friends made and good will spread around among the Puys all through the day. We shook hands and left, impatiently waiting for the next gathering.</p>

            <p>51 Puys! The greatest turnout yet. There was not event one chair left unoccupied in the hall. The enthusiasm of such a large crowd does give us all a hint about the demand in the industry for beginner level Python training. With the organizer, <a href="https://twitter.com/kracetheking">Kracekumar</a> himself facilitating the workshop, the in-depth beginner level session was received by the crowd with much appreciation. The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/171450392/">April Bangpypers meetup</a> happened at the Akamai office near Bellandur. <a href="https://twitter.com/k4rtik">Kartik</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/harisibrahimkv">Haris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chowdhury_sayan">Sayan</a> came forward as volunteers. The session started at 10:30AM and concluded around 6:00PM.</p>

<p>Kicking off the workshop by getting to know the crowd better, Krace quickly got into the exercises, thereby getting everyone hands-on. The workshop was structured as a series of exercises in folder, along with their respective solutions in another. The material was shared in advance with the audience. The instructor went over each exercise (which were separated into individual files) by first demoing the concept using the Python interpreter and then letting the audience try it out within the file. You can find the course content comprising of the exercises and solutions <a href="https://github.com/kracekumar/pythonbyexamplestutorial">here</a>.</p>

<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/m-BXqkrQVC/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>The session was riddled with questions from the participants. Being a man of patience, Krace took all of them, refined them and gave a solid explanation along with all the answers. We broke for lunch at about 1:30PM. Akamai was generous enough to sponsor huge mean boxes consisting of rice, curries, sweets and a pack of juice. We wrapped up luch by 2:30PM, at the point which Akamai gave us a short demo of their world wide service. All of us were taken into a room that resembled the cockpit of a spaceship where on a huge screen, you could see the globe rotating, having streaks of green and yellow depicting Akamai&#39;s realtime traffic, which apparently consisted of 40% of the world&#39;s!</p>

<p>The workshop resumed at 2:45PM, continuing from list, dictionaries, list &amp; dictionary comprehensions to files, error handling and standard libraries. The session covered all these and went on till about 6:00PM. Although that was more than the estimated time, the audience did not have the slightest of problems with the delay, due to the excellent workshop. Krace, having imparted the best practices, basic Python knowledge as well as the idiomatic approach to writing Python code, concluded his session by pointing them at other resources which they could follow up with as exercises.</p>

<p>At around 6:15, all of us parted, exchanging good-byes and wishing each other to meet within another month!</p>

            <p>&ldquo;Writing tests is an absolute waste of time&rdquo;, some of them say.</p>

<p>Well, we do not think so. The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/125797622/">March Bangpypers meetup</a> was a hands on workshop covering TDD with Django. Just like last time, an enthusiastic crowd of 42 attended the session. It was held at the Apigee office in Koramangala. Facilitated by <a href="https://twitter.com/sivaa_in">Siva</a>, the session started at around 10:30AM and went on till 3:30PM. Unlike the previous sessions, <a href="https://twitter.com/kracetheking">Kracekumar</a> was the only volunteer to help the participants.</p>

<p>The workshop started by telling everyone the importance of writing tests, the concept and theory of Test Driven Development and how it could help one tremendously while writing code. Although a bit hectic at first, it is a practice that would certainly pay off when it comes to catching the bugs in your code before it is deployed in production. <a href="https://github.com/sivaa/django-tdd">The Repo and the session notes can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>The session focussed on using <strong>selenium</strong> for writing functional tests and the Python <strong>unittest</strong> library for writing unit tests. As you can see from the notes, each step was implemented step by step, one at a time making sure that the crowd was following along. The functional tests were bundled in a standalone package whereas the unittests were written within the tests.py file of the newly created Django app.</p>

<p>The concept of writing tests for a piece of code that was not written, was quite alien to almost all the participants. &ldquo;TDD is like martial arts&rdquo;, stated Siva towards the end. &ldquo;You cannot learn it in one day. First you have to go through all the troublesome exercises before getting to the actual kicking and punching part&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Making voluntary, common mistakes in his code, the instructor made the participant experience newbie mistakes that anyone could make. Thereby making them think it through and finding a solution. The well laid out exercise along with the elegant presentation imparted a great deal of knowledge to the attendees.</p>

<p>The workshop was wrapped up by 3:30PM after which, all of us hungout a bit talking to each other about different technologies and how they compare with each other. Certain participants had a couple of doubts about the session to be clearted who stuck with Siva for a while to get everything cleared.</p>

<p>By 4:15, all of us were on our ways, waiting to come together once more for the next meetup!</p>

            <p>Surprisingly, the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/125797572/">February Bangpypers meetup</a> witnessed a whooping crowd of 46 Puys attending it. The LinkedIN office space where it was being held, had to be modified a little in order to accommodate everyone comfortably. The meetup was in the form a full-day hands on beginner level Python workshop. It was facilitated by <a href="https://twitter.com/harisibrahimkv">Haris Ibrahim K. V.</a> The agenda was to work through problems, thereby introducing and teaching Python. <a href="https://twitter.com/kracetheking">Kracekumar</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sivaa_in">Siva</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chowdhury_sayan">Sayan</a> and Souradeep came forward willingly to help the participants out whenever they had any doubt.</p>

<p>The workshop, which was supposed to commence at 10:00AM, got delayed by half an hour as people were pouring in one after the other. It started off by teaching everyone to <a href="https://xkcd.com/353/">fly with Python</a> by importing &#39;antigravity&#39;. After the initial gimmick was done with, the customary &ldquo;Hello world&rdquo; program was written, comparing it with the way it would be if this was a beginner Java or C workshop. God forbid.</p>

<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/kb9H-KNT4Q/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>The instructor used a library book storing application as an exercise that was continuously built upon during the duration of the course. He had another set of questions which were used to demonstrate and understand certain specific concepts. The audience had a mix of absolute Python beginners as well as others who had a little bit of experience using it. The willingness to learn along with their warm and friendly nature gave the gathering a pleasant atmosphere both in terms of learning Python as well as interacting during the session.</p>

<p>The topics covered included:<br>
* Working with the basic data types<br>
* Understanding Data structures well such as dictionaries, lists and tuples<br>
* Control flow statements including if, for loop and while loop<br>
* Writing functions and understanding parameter passing<br>
* File IO<br>
* A short introduction to writing classes</p>

<p>The workshop finished around 3:30PM. Everyone hung out for a while discussing the various areas where Python was used, the various resources to learn Python from followed by a short talk by LinkedIN on where they were using Python and how. Everyone collected the cool t-shirts LinkedIN was giving away and parted, looking forward to the next meetup.</p>

            <h3>Django unchained!</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BangPypers/events/125797552/">January Bangpypers</a> meetup happened at the <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/yFcov">Apigee office</a>. The organizers, as a part of trying to improvise and improve the quality of the meetups, decided to do a full day session on using the Python Django framework. The trio of <a href="https://twitter.com/sivaa_in">Siva</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chowdhury_sayan">Sayan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/harisibrahimkv">Haris</a> were burdened with the responsibility of preparing the content and delivering the workshop. Siva put forward the idea of doing the tutorial in a step by step manner. He created the tutorial content on GitHub with a branch for each step. Find the repo <a href="https://github.com/sivaa/django-workshop">here</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/k4rtik">Kartik</a> accompanied the team to help out the participants.</p>
<h2>Workshop</h2>
<p>The workshop commenced at 10:30AM with around 25 participants.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/chowdhury_sayan">Sayan</a> kicked off by introducing Django, its features and its structure. He further dived down deep into describing the various settings as well sa workflow possible thereby imparting a solid structure to the participants. He wound up his instroductory session at around 11.15AM.</p>

<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/jTKlvGLQTc/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Next up, it was <a href="https://twitter.com/harisibrahimkv">Haris</a> who had to handle the first and second tutorials. Enlightening the crowd with the customary &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; application, he started by explaining how the different parts of a Django project tied together. He explained and demonstrated by giving a hands on session regarding writing a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; app. He presented both the approach of directly returning a response as well as using a template in order to render the HTML. He finished off his session in about an hour.</p>

<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/jTJWcTrQSI/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Just before lunch break, <a href="https://twitter.com/sivaa_in">Siva</a> took the stage and introduced the flow and structure of the third tutorial. Once everyone got the idea of what was coming, the gathering took a break for lunch at 1:00PM and had some awesome pizzas sposored by <a href="http://apigee.com/about/">Apigee</a>. Everyone got back together at 1:45PM and the session commenced. He had explained each step of his tutorial one by one in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/sivaa/8486393">gist</a>. This helped the participants a lot in terms of getting together their bearings once things went too far for them to follow.</p>

<p>Demoing and giving a hands on workshop covering each step one by one, he imparted a clear view of how Django worked, how they could do useful things and how to carry it on forward. The concept of views, forms, models, templating engine, MVT as well validation were covered with simple but non-trivial examples. He concluded his session by 3.15PM by giving a few advices on best practices to follow.</p>

<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/jTTpkFrQaq/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

<p>Sayan again took the stage in order to explain in detail the admin features as well about the templating. He went on explaining about how the admin would automatically generate fields for all the models written in a particular Django project to how the templating engine works. Its capabilities, features and best practices of using it. He finished off the last part around 4.315PM.</p>

<p>By this time, the audience were really interested to know more about and around the Python community. They had been really interactive during the workshop, following each line, asking doubts and making sure they learnt whatver was being taught. Towards the end, questions, both related to Django as well as Python started pouring in. It was a wonderful time where the instructors as well as [Krace][], the main organizer, addressed each of their queries one by one.</p>

<p>Questions regarding flask v/s Django, Django ORM, static files, templating engine, deployment, learning curve and a lot more were asked and discussed. The meeting was adjourned at 5PM and everyone parted to their own ways after exchanging good byes.</p>

<h2>Talks</h2>
<p>After finishing the workshop as well as lunch, everyone gathered back at the TW hall around 3PM and the sessions started at around 3:20PM.</p>

<p>The sessions kicked off with <a href="https://twitter.com/kracetheking">Kracekumar</a>&#39;s introduction to iPython. He started off by explaining the various difficulties that users face while fiddling around with the normal Python shell, multiline editing being the major bottle neck. He went one explaining the myriad of features that came with iPython that helped make life much easier.<br>
Auto-completion, iPython notebook, running system command from within the interpreter, getting help for the objects, and ended with displaying <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/">nbviewer</a>, where you could share your iPython notebooks as gists. You can find his notebook <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/kracekumar/8059932">here</a>.</p>

<p>Next up was <a href="https://twitter.com/shoaibnajeeb">Shoaib Najeeb</a> with his talk on using Cassandra from Pycassa. It was quite an elaborate talk where he started right from the basics explaining the NoSQL database layout contrasting it with the RDBMS ones. After having gotten everyone on the same page with the Cassandra basics, he then moved onto explaining the CAP theorem as well as the configuration required on Pycassa to get it up and running. The session was extremely interactive where he was bombarded with questions, all of which he replied to to the best of his knowledge. As time was running out, leaving his audience thirsty for more, he concluded his session by 5:40PM. The link to his presentation will be updated soon.</p>

<p>To end the day&#39;s fireworks, we had <a href="https://twitter.com/fayaz">Fayaz</a> presenting his session on logging. He started off from the basics, explaining the need for logging in any project that was going into production. Moving forward by sharing some of his insights into the best practices of using logging, he introduced various features that came with the library. He also mentioned some useful utilities such as the Redis Handler, the FingersCrossedHandler as well as the TicketingHandler. Having convinced his audience to go back and get started with logging, he wound up his session by 6:15PM, thereby bringing the meetup to an end. His presentation shall be shared soon.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who attended and let&#39;s keep the ball rolling folks!</p>

<p>During recording  audio input was mistakenly connected to audio output of<br>
the lecture recorder, as a result audio for Siva&#39;s session was lost.<br>
Unfortunately camera backup of the video was delayed in recording and only<br>
speaker face was focused, as a result video is now unusable. Sorry :-(.</p>
